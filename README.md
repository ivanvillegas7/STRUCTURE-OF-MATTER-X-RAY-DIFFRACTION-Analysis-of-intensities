# STRUCTURE OF MATTER: X RAY DIFFRACTION: Analysis of intensities
Repository with all the information, data, plots and programs used for EM P1 of Laboratorio de Física IV at Universidad de Cantabria (UniCan).

In folder "Theory-Information" you will find all the needed theory as weel as some exples of unit cells and how to do the analysis. In folder "structure" you will find some structures that may be of interest. All the studied samples, as weel as some others, can be find here. The file 'M1-0001.x_y' contains all the data related to my sample (my sample was M1-0001, it turned out to be Sylvite or KCl). With the Python program 'difractogram.py' you will be able to do your own difractogram for your own data, as well as the angular data and the sine square for the first six visible peaks. It will save the difractogram (file named 'difractograma M1-0001.pdf' for you as an output. The file 'PowerCell.zip' you can find all the files needed to install PowerCell. You will find another difractogram (with the model for KCl) mad with PowerCell in file 'mod.BMP'.

The file 'Difracción de Rayos X - Iván Villegas Pérez.pdf' is the final report (in Spanish) with additional questions.
